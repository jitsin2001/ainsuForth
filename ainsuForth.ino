// wa1tnr: it is striking that the sketch uses 9444 bytes,
// before and after the changes made during this single commit.
// It would appear that the compiler already knew something
// non-obvious about the (then) current involvement of the
// lines commented-out during this (one) commit -- they didn't
// have any involvement (or they had very little of it).

// That came about earlier -- their irrelevancy to the compiler -- 
// that's the difficulty; comprehension of why that is the case.

// This is something to pay attention to.
