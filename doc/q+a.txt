questions and answers

very short term - rapidly out of date.

  Q: Hey, how come the dotstar is blue and not changing?
  A: Error!  Connect to the stamp (via USB) a bit sooner than
     expected, and the tri-color strobe does not complete (at
     least, sometimes, it doesn't).  Mine's halted on blue.
     No harm, no foul.  Continue.

     You can cause this error on purpose by using the 'warm'
     word, then quickly reconnecting to the target via USB
     (at least on Linux and when using microcom, you can).

     It depends on how you make the serial connection
     (via USB) happen.  There seems to be more than one way
     to do it.

     With microcom, after a 'warm' you get an 'Invalid argument'
     error (from microcom, perhaps?) and regain the system shell
     (bash for most people).  From there, just 'microcom' again
     (with parameters, as previously given).  If you do so early
     enough after a 'warm' you'll freeze-frame the dotstar in
     whatever colour it was, when you intercepted!

  Q: Why the SPI lib right now?
  A: Probably for another target.  We are Gemma M0 right now --
     no room for an SPI flash chip on this target.

     APPEARS TO BE AN ERROR that can be ignored for the moment
     (19 November 2017).

     $ pwd
       .arduino15/packages/adafruit/hardware/samd/1.0.18/variants/gemma_m0

     $ cat -n variant.h | egrep SPI
       117   * SPI Interfaces
       119  #define SPI_INTERFACES_COUNT 0 // :( not enough pins

     Not sure how this (SPI lib) is getting pulled in, at compile time.

END.
