My attempt to describe what's going on here.

The b.s. is mine -- out of my depth on this.

Driving 8 NeoPixel modules with a level-shifting
buffer 74HCT125N or similar, from the Feather M0 Basic
target board (from Adafruit)


The Circuit connections

D12 is a GPIO from the Feather M0 basic target
board, and is routed to the junction of D1, D2 and R1
(a clamp/protection circuit for port i/o D12).

D1 and D2 are 1N4148 signal diodes, which are
connected in series, reverse-polarity, across
the 3.3 volt power supply of the target board.

The diodes do not conduct unless the GPIO pin
goes more negative that 0.0 volts, or more
positive than 3.3 volts.  This is meant to
prevent the port pin from (at least some)
excursions outside its absolute maximum ratings.


The output from (470 ohm) R1 drives one input
(signal 1A) of a 74HCT125 quad buffer/level-
translator (which accepts a 2 volt input as
a logical HIGH, and drives 5 volts (to Vcc) in
buffered output at Pin 3 (signal 1Y).

Pin 1 (O0enble) is tied to ground (signal: enable
buffer output).

In this way, the GPIO pin D12 of the SAMD21 micro
is directly clamped to Vdd (+3.3v) and to GND, and
is resistively coupled to the level-translating
buffer (IC1) which in turn drives the data input
(D-in) of the RGB array, at Vcc level, through a
second 470 ohm resistor.  The buffer chip (IC1) is
referenced to Vcc (+5.0v).

C1 is a 0.1 uF bypass capacitor (ceramic) to reduce
noise coming in through Vcc.

errata

Multiple -- first try at Fritzing.  The 470 ohm
coupling resistors (R1, R2) are mismarked as 220 ohm
in the Fritzing drawing.  D1 and D2 began life as
1N4001 PSU rectifiers -- they are supposed to be 1N914B (or
equivalent, locally specified as 1N4148 signal diodes).

Fritzing module for the quad buffer 74HCT125N not found,
and 14-pin packages were difficult to discover individually,
so in this instance a random 14-pin DIP (picaxe?) was
substituted, since this is a mechanical drawing only
(no attempt is made to work with the rest of Fritzing,
to connect nodes logically to their purpose and so on).
