My attempt to describe what's going on here.

The b.s. is mine -- out of my depth on this.

Driving 8 NeoPixel modules with a level-shifting
buffer 74HCT125N or similar, from the Feather M0 Basic
target board (from Adafruit)


The Circuit connections

D12 is a GPIO from the Feather M0 basic target
board, and is routed to the junction of D1, D2 and R1
(a clamp/protection circuit for port i/o D12).

D1 and D2 are 1N4148 signal diodes, which are
connected in series, reverse-polarity, across
the 3.3 volt power supply of the target board.

The diodes do not conduct unless the GPIO pin
goes more negative that 0.0 volts, or more
positive than 3.3 volts.  This is meant to
prevent the port pin from (at least some)
excursions outside its absolute maximum ratings.


The output from (470 ohm) R1 drives one input
(signal 1A) of a 74HCT125 quad buffer/level-
translator (which accepts a 2 volt input as
a logical HIGH, and drives 5 volts (to Vcc) in
buffered output at Pin 3 (signal 1Y).

Pin 1 (O0enble) is tied to ground (signal: enable
buffer output).

In this way, the GPIO pin D12 of the SAMD21 micro
is directly clamped to Vdd (+3.3v) and to GND, and
is resistively coupled to the level-translating
buffer (IC1) which in turn drives the data input
(D-in) of the RGB array, at Vcc level, through a
second 470 ohm resistor.  The buffer chip (IC1) is
referenced to Vcc (+5.0v).

C1 is a 0.1 uF bypass capacitor (ceramic) to reduce
noise coming in through Vcc.

errata

Multiple -- first try at Fritzing.  The 470 ohm
coupling resistors (R1, R2) are mismarked as 220 ohm
in the Fritzing drawing.  D1 and D2 began life as
1N4001 PSU rectifiers -- they are supposed to be 1N914B (or
equivalent, locally specified as 1N4148 signal diodes).

Fritzing module for the quad buffer 74HCT125N not found,
and 14-pin packages were difficult to discover individually,
so in this instance a random 14-pin DIP (picaxe?) was
substituted, since this is a mechanical drawing only
(no attempt is made to work with the rest of Fritzing,
to connect nodes logically to their purpose and so on).

Pinout is 1-7 then 8-14 on SN74AHCT125N, starting at
upper left (top view) and working counter-clockwise, with
dimple oriented up top as well.

 1 - 1OE-not (GND this to enable)
 2 - 1A (2.0 VDC buffered input)
 3 - 1Y (5.0 VDC buffered output)
 4 - 2OE
 5 - 2A
 6 - 2Y
 7 - GND

 8 - 3Y
 9 - 3A
10 - 3OE
11 - 4Y
12 - 4A
13 - 4OE
14 - Vcc +5.0 VDC

Pins 6, 8 and 11 are outputs 2Y, 3Y and 4Y and are left floating.

All enable signals (Pins 1, 4, 10 and 13) are tied to GND
(they are LOW==enabled) for future expansion.

Pins 5, 9 and 12 are inputs 2A, 3A and 4A and are tied to ground
(See their NOTE 4 in the datasheet).

"Each output is disabled when the associated output-enable (OE-not)
 input is high.  When OE-not is low, the respective gate passes the
 data from the A input to its Y output."

If you need the output disabled during power up or power down, use
a pullup to Vcc on the enable pin.

Absolute Maximum Ratings

Vcc   7.0 VDC.
Input  Vi -0.5 V to 7 V
Output Vo -0.5 V to Vcc + 0.5 V

Recommended Operating Conditions

Vcc  min 4.5  max 5.5 VDC (recommended supply voltage range)
Vih  2.0 VDC (logic HIGH-level input voltage)
Vil  0.8 VDC (logic LOW-level input voltage)
Vi   min 0.0  max 5.5 VDC (input voltage range)
Vo   min 0.0  max Vcc
Ioh  -8 mA (logic HIGH-level output current)
Iol   8 mA (logic LOW-level output current)
delta-t/delta-v  20 ns/V (Input transition rise or fall rate)
Ta   min -40  max 85 degrees Celsius

NOTE 4 says "ALL UNUSED INPUTS of the device must be held
at Vcc or GND to ensure proper device operation."  Then it
refers to the Texas Instruments application report,
"Implications of Slow or Floating CMOS inputs", literature
number SCBA004.




A note on rendering

Where right angles are shown, in general, if aligned to
horizontal or vertical axes, assume a DC interconnect at
any node.

For angular runs (30-45 degrees often used) assume the
intent was to depict no interconnects, even at 90 degree
crossings (so long as both wires are well off the horizontal
or vertical axes, and run at some angle to the rest of
the drawing, even though mutually perpendicular: this is
meant as 'not connected' where this happens).

At the moment, there are no such connections depicted.
The one remaining was rerouted around the 8-neopixel
strip, at extreme right, to show the two grounds are
connected together (at the protoboard GND bus; two
separate full-length wires are run in parallel with
Vcc and D-in lines).
